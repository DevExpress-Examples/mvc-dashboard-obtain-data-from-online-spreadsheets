# BI Dashboard for ASP.NET MVC - How to Obtain Data for Web Dashboard from Online Spreadsheets

This is a sample project that connects Dashboard to a Google Drive spreadsheet. 

Follow the steps below to create a data source based on the online spreadsheet:

1. Set *MvcDashboard* as a startup project and launch the application.
2. Click the **Sign in GoogleDrive** button to signÂ into the Google Account and allow the current application to view files in your Google Drive. 
3. After redirection click the **Add New ExcelDataSource** button to select the requiredÂ spreadsheetÂ file and data (sheets, tables, or named ranges). 
The created data source is nowÂ available for your dashboards.

Note that thisÂ sampleÂ projectÂ isÂ a prototype that shows the possibilityÂ of usingÂ aÂ third-party API to extendÂ theÂ Web Dashboard functionality.Â We do not plan to make access to GoogleÂ Drive a built-in feature in Web Dashboard in the near future,Â butÂ you can use the provided project as a starting point to implement this functionality in your project.
